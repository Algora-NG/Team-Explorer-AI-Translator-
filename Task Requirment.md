# WEEKLY TASK REQUIREMENT

## **Week 1: Requirement Gathering and Dataset Exploration**
**Goals:**

- Define project scope and deliverables.
- Identify datasets for the six languages.
- Assess existing tools and technologies for text and voice translation.

## **Week 2: Data Preprocessing Pipeline
Goals:**

Clean and preprocess datasets.
Tokenize text, normalize characters (e.g., accents, tone marks).
Handle imbalanced datasets through augmentation or other methods.

##**Week 3: Baseline Translation Models
Goals:**

Train initial models using pre-trained architectures (e.g., MarianMT, OpenNMT).
Fine-tune models on the cleaned datasets.

## **Week 4: Voice-to-Text Integration
Goals:**

Integrate voice input using ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition).
Evaluate voice-to-text models for supported languages (e.g., Google Speech-to-Text, DeepSpeech).

## **Week 5: Text-to-Voice Functionality
Goals:**

Implement text-to-speech (TTS) functionality.
Evaluate naturalness and clarity of synthesized voices for each language.

## **Week 6: API Development
Goals:**

Design and implement RESTful APIs for translation (text and voice).
Test API endpoints for performance and reliability.

## **Week 7: Frontend and User Testing
Goals:**

Develop a simple web interface for testing.
Conduct user testing with native speakers of each language.

## **Week 8: Model Optimization and Scaling
Goals:**

Optimize models for speed and accuracy.
Add support for more complex sentence structures and domain-specific contexts.

## **Week 9: Deployment and Feedback
Goals:**

Deploy models and APIs on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure).
Collect real-world feedback from early adopters.

## **Week 10: Expansion Plan
Goals:**

Plan for additional languages and features.
Propose long-term goals (e.g., mobile app integration, more accents).
